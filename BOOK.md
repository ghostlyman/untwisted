The rapidserv plugin
====================

Rapidserv is a micro web framework that is built on top of a powerful asynchronous networking library. It shares with flask
some similarities in the design of the applications that are built on top of rapidserv. Rapidserv is non blocking network I/O
consequently it can scale a lot of connections and it is ideal for some applications. 
Rapidserv uses jinja2 although it doesn't enforce the usage.
